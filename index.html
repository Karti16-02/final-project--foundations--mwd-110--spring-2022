    <h2>BackgroundüëΩ</h2>
    <p>Rod Stackx is a 19-year old Hip Hop artist born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. His smooth flows and quality word play gives his music a unique vibe and euphoric feeling.‚Ä® At an early age, Rod had a deep passion and love for music. Growing up, he was inspired by several other hip hop artists such as Lil Wayne, Lil Uzi Vert, Playboi Carti, and Nav.  Rod transitioned from a fanatic listener to an artist in August of 2020 and has sparked a path for his music career ever since.</p>
    <p>Rod Stackx was already talented and gifted since the day I met him. Rod was always showing his drive and passion on the court while playing basketball. Rod has also shown that he can excel in all areas that he is thrown into. This gives him the title of MR.DO IT ALL!!! In his and the world's eyes, there is no limit to what he can do.</p>
    <p>Rod‚Äôs first released song was Sky High. Sky High was a song that really made a statement in who he really is. After Sky High, Rod Stackx made even more songs that have their own vibe. If I were to describe his music, I would say his music can give a space, slime, or rage vibe.</p>
    <p>Rod Stackx‚Äôs latest drop was an EP called Rock The World. In this EP, listeners finally got a sense of what kind of music Rod makes. In the song No More, listeners can see that Rod only wants to be around real people. In this world there are alot of fake vibes and negativity. This was the first song that people got that had a sense of rage and aggression. The last song in the Ep was Celestial. The whole idea of this song was to make people feel like they are leaving Earth. It was the perfect closing song due to the fact that it helps people understand that in today;s society we live in the matrix. It is not just a mere goal but a mission to escape the matrix and live life the best way you see possible.</p>
